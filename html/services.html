        <h2>HOME GYM SETUP</h2>
        <div class="serv-desc">
          <p>
            Home installation is not an easy job. It is a task better left to
            the expert to take care of. Installation is not something that you
            should be doing on your own. A wrong installation will only lead to
            a myriad of dilemmas you would not want to deal with. If you have no
            proper training with the task at hand, you might just end up injured
            in addition to the dilemmas such as equipment breakdown or
            deterioration. If you think that this scenario is just as fine as
            there is a warranty â€“ forget all about it. Refunding through
            warranty offered by the manufacturer only applies when the equipment
            are properly assembled. So if you are thinking of installing a home
            gym all by yourself, you must stop and rethink the idea
            thoughtfully.

        <h2>PERSONAL COACHING/TRAINING</h2>

        <div class="serv-desc">
          <p>
            Achieving the fitness results you want can sometimes feel
            overwhelming with so many experts giving advice on diet, exercise,
            and even sleep. Joining a gym can be equally perplexing. From
            navigating the exercise machines to developing a routine that
            achieves your personal goals can be daunting tasks. If you've been
            trying to increase your fitness activity but keep making excuses or
            are unsure of the best course of action, the X-BOOST team of
            certified professionals can help. We are the largest in home
            personal training service in the United States and Canada. We bring
            the workout to you: the equipment, the trainer, and a personalized
            workout to match your goals and your skill level.
